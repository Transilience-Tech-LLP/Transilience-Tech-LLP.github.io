# Chinese Spying Revealed yet again!

Apple is about to push it latest iOS 14 this year. In 14, Apple has fixed a flaw where apps could secretly read the clipboard. Its a major risk, since a lot of private data may be copied to clipboard, which would be snooped in on by malicious apps. In 14 Apple warns users whenever something is copied to be app from the global Clipboard, this way the end user may be aware of when something is being read off the clipboard (The data that we store when copying using the copy button or pressing ctrl + c on keyboard).

One of the apps that abuses this feature as brought out by security researchers Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk was TikTok. TikTok has become a major content sharing platform over the past few years and given its Chinese origins, it certainly is a matter of utmost concern that the Chinese are behind it yet again. TikTok owner Bytedance had said that the problem related to the use of an outdated Google advertising SDK that is being replaced.

With the new iOS 14 feature of warning users when something is copied off the clipboard, should be able to adequately warn the end users when something is being “stolen” by an app, even if it is clipboard data.

According to TikTok, the issue is triggered by a feature designed to identify repetitive, spammy behavior, and that it has “already submitted an updated version of the app to the App Store removing the anti-spam feature to eliminate any potential confusion.”

The Chinese apps and corporations have been time and again caught doing something naughty and then they blame it on something and rush to fix that. The trend seems to have surfaced quiet often.

As reported by Zak Doffman, when enquired TikTok on the clipboard issue, the company was adamant it was not their problem and related to an outdated library in their app. “The clipboard access issues,” a spokesperson told me, “showed up due to third-party SDKs, in our case an older version Google Ads SDK, so we do not get access to the information through this (presumably they do but we cannot speak to that). We are in the processes of updating so that the third-party SDK will no longer have access.”

Apple’s latest OS, iOS 14 security and privacy changes have caught TikTok red-handed still capturing the clipboard, which they shouldn’t. Reading off the phone itself is not the sole issue, it is the Apple’s universal clipboard functionality, which in effect means that anything copied on Mac or iPad can be read by a malicious app on iPhone, and vice versa, which can contain a lot of sensitive stuff like Passwords, work documents, sensitive emails, financial information.

All iPhone users must therefore update to the latest version of iOS as soon as it is available in the stable channel, and also keep an eye on the snoopy apps that the phone has.
