  desc: A team of academic researchers—who previously made the headlines earlier this year for uncovering severe security issues in the 4G LTE and 5G networks —today presented a new attack called ' ReVoLTE ,' that could let remote attackers break the encryption used by VoLTE voice calls and spy on targeted phone calls. The attack doesn't exploit any flaw in the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) protocol; instead, it leverages weak implementation of the LTE mobile network by most telecommunication providers in practice, allowing an attacker to eavesdrop on the encrypted phone calls made by targeted victims. VoLTE or Voice over Long Term Evolution protocol is a standard high-speed wireless communication for mobile phones and data terminals, including Internet of things (IoT) devices and wearables, deploying 4G LTE radio access technology. The crux of the problem is that most mobile operators often use the same keystream for two subsequent calls.

  desc: Attention! If you use Amazon's voice assistant Alexa in you smart speakers, just opening an innocent-looking web-link could let attackers install hacking skills on it and spy on your activities remotely. Check Point cybersecurity researchers—Dikla Barda, Roman Zaikin and Yaara Shriki—today disclosed severe security vulnerabilities in Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant that could render it vulnerable to a number of malicious attacks. According to a new report released by Check Point Research and shared with The Hacker News, the "exploits could have allowed an attacker to remove/install skills on the targeted victim's Alexa account, access their voice history and acquire personal information through skill interaction when the user invokes the installed skill." "Smart speakers and virtual assistants are so commonplace that it's easy to overlook just how much personal data they hold, and their role in controlling other smart devices in our homes.

  desc: Microsoft earlier today released its August 2020 batch of software security updates for all supported versions of its Windows operating systems and other products. This month's Patch Tuesday updates address a total of 120 newly discovered software vulnerabilities, of which 17 are critical, and the rest are important in severity. In a nutshell, your Windows computer can be hacked if you Play a video file — thanks to flaws in Microsoft Media Foundation and Windows Codecs Listen to audio — thanks to bugs affecting Windows Media Audio Codec Browser a website — thanks to 'all time buggy' Internet Explorer Edit an HTML page — thanks to an MSHTML Engine flaw Read a PDF — thanks to a loophole in Microsoft Edge PDF Reader Receive an email message — thanks to yet another bug in Microsoft Outlook But don't worry, you don't need to stop using your computer or without Windows OS on it.

  desc: New research disclosed a string of severe security vulnerabilities in the ' Find My Mobile '—an Android app that comes pre-installed on most Samsung smartphones—that could have allowed remote attackers to track victims' real-time location, monitor phone calls, and messages, and even delete data stored on the phone. Portugal-based cybersecurity services provider Char49 revealed its findings on Samsung's Find My Mobile Android app at the DEF CON conference last week and shared details with the Hacker News. "This flaw, after setup, can be easily exploited and with severe implications for the user and with a potentially catastrophic impact permanent denial of service via phone lock, complete data loss with factory reset (SD card included), serious privacy implication via IMEI and location tracking as well as call and SMS log access," Char49's Pedro Umbelino said in technical analysis.

  desc: As software eats the world, the world faces a software security crisis. The movement to modern software such as cloud technologies and microservice architectures is essential to innovate quickly. Yet, nearly three in four developers say that security slows down Agile and DevOps. Neither developers nor security teams are to blame. DevOps speed is held back by a 15-year-old, scan-based application security (AppSec) model designed for the early 2000s. Traditional security tools cannot keep up with today's rapid development pace or modern application portfolio scale. However, sacrificing security for development speed places critical and confidential personal and business information at risk—from financial to healthcare data—and can disrupt operations or even cause outages. Code Scanners Cannot Meet Modern DevOps Legacy AppSec approaches that rely on point-in-time scanning are plagued by development delays and highly inaccurate results.

  desc: Citrix today released patches for multiple new security vulnerabilities affecting its Citrix Endpoint Management (CEM) , also known as XenMobile, a product made for enterprises to help companies manage and secure their employees' mobile devices remotely. Citrix Endpoint Management offers businesses mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) capabilities. It allows companies to control which apps their employees can install while ensuring updates and security settings are applied to keep business information protected. According to Citrix, there are a total of 5 vulnerabilities that affect on-premise instances of XenMobile servers used in enterprises to manage all apps, devices, or platforms from one central location. "Remediations have already been applied to cloud versions, but hybrid rights users need to apply the upgrades to any on-premises instance," the company sai d in a post today.
