The attack doesn't exploit any flaw in the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) protocol; instead, it leverages weak implementation of the LTE mobile network by most telecommunication providers in practice, allowing an attacker to eavesdrop on the encrypted phone calls made by targeted victims. VoLTE or Voice over Long Term Evolution protocol is a standard high-speed wireless communication for mobile phones and data terminals, including Internet of things (IoT) devices and wearables, deploying 4G LTE radio access technology. The crux of the problem is that most mobile operators often use the same keystream for two subsequent calls.", "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2020/08/a-team-of-academic-researcherswho.html"}, {"title": "Amazon Alexa Bugs Allowed Hackers to Install Malicious Skills Remotely", "img": "https://thehackernews.com/images/-VnO535P82gw/XzT0WFeD-VI/AAAAAAAA3ME/CWY9e8qkomgP6y_BZ2TLDpDIvrhBkMmmACLcBGAsYHQ/s728-e100/Amazon_Alexa-hacking.png", "desc": "Attention!

The movement to modern software such as cloud technologies and microservice architectures is essential to innovate quickly. Yet, nearly three in four developers say that security slows down Agile and DevOps.   Neither developers nor security teams are to blame. DevOps speed is held back by a 15-year-old, scan-based application security (AppSec) model designed for the early 2000s. Traditional security tools cannot keep up with today's rapid development pace or modern application portfolio scale.   However, sacrificing security for development speed places critical and confidential personal and business information at risk\u2014from financial to healthcare data\u2014and can disrupt operations or even cause outages.
