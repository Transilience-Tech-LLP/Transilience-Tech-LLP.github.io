    summary: A Penetration Test (Pen Test) involves simulating the effects of a hacker attempting to break into your network. The problem with most other tests is that they are pre-built software programs, designed to run against your network. However, hackers arenâ€™t software! A software solution can in no way properly simulate how a human being will try to enter your network and damage or steal your information. Since you need an unbiased, honest look at your network, you still need to find an outside organization to test your security. Whether you need our team to conduct a penetration test of your security controls, an assessment of your security architecture, or even a gap analysis to see how you match up against industry standards, our expert consultants can deliver. We have experience working across industries and welcome challenging scenarios.
