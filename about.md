# About US

Transilience Tech is about people.

We started off as a group of unknown individuals, who have been working in various fields of their expertise, however we saw the corporate and industry demands shift yet the businesses failed to evolve and thus suffered. The new era is about **Cloud Computing**, **Blockchain Technology**, **Scalable Infrastructure**, **DevOps**, **Artifical Intelligence** and **Security**.

Therefore we came together, with an idea of creating something that we cared about, working closely with our clients to deliver the best possible solutions in the field of **Information Technology** and **Cyber Security**.

Our Subject Matter Experts have a wide expertise both in **Development** and **Security**.

We are talkitive people, and our love for great coffee brings us closer to our Clients. Give us a tinkle or mail us and we will reach out to you for the best experience.
